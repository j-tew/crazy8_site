# A small contribution to the community

A simple Django website for a local sports bar and grill in Denton. They closed their doors before we could deploy the site, so this is strictly for archival purposes.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/j-tew/crazy8s_site.git`
2. Go into the project directory
`cd crazy8s_site`
3. Create a virtual environment
`python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment
`source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the app
`python manage.py runserver`
7. View the webpage by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your web browser
